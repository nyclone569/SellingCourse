# Learning Project: SellingCourse

This is a learning project that I developed as part of my ReactJS course at [SpaceDev](https://spacedev.vn/course/react). It serves as a hands-on exercise to help solidify the concepts and skills learned throughout the course.

## üöÄ Project Template

The template for this project is based on the HTML template provided in the course, which can be found at:  
[Frontend Template for ReactJS Course](https://github.com/dangthuyenvuong/frontend-template/tree/master/course_html_template).

In addition to the frontend, this course also covers the backend development and API testing using **Postman**. The project template includes:

- **Frontend**: Built with ReactJS, using Vite as the development tool.
- **Backend**: Developed using **Node.js** and **MongoDB** to manage and store data.
- **API Testing**: Postman is used to test the API endpoints to ensure they work correctly.

This comprehensive template provides a full-stack approach, covering both the frontend and backend aspects of building a course-selling platform, as well as API testing to verify the backend functionality.

## ‚ú® Key Features
- **ReactJS Components**: Utilizing functional components, hooks, and state management.
- **Learning Focus**: This project covers the core ReactJS concepts such as JSX, props, state, useEffect, useHooks, and event handling.

## üéØ Purpose

This project is meant for educational purposes and serves as an implementation of key ReactJS principles in a real-world scenario. It is intended to help beginners and learners get practical experience with ReactJS.

## ‚ö° Important
The following features have been successfully implemented in the project:

- **Sign up through email and sign in**: Users can sign up and sign in using their email addresses.
- **Change profile**: Users can update their profile information, including name, email, phone number, and other details.
- **Contact form validation and submission**: The contact form allows users to submit inquiries, with built-in validation to ensure the information is correct before submission.
- **View course list and course details**: Users can view a list of available courses and access detailed information about each course.
- **Register for a course**: Users can register for courses.

Still, some features are still in development and are not yet fully implemented in the current version. These features will be added in future updates:

- **Real course purchase functionality**: Purchase courses online will be available.
- **Project completion tracking**: Tracking which course you have completed.
- **Payment history**: Users will be able to view their past transactions.
- **Coin management**: The system for earning and managing virtual coins (which can be used as discounts for future courses).
