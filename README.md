# Learning Project: SellingCourse

This is a learning project that I developed as part of my ReactJS course at [SpaceDev](https://spacedev.vn/course/react). It serves as a hands-on exercise to help solidify the concepts and skills learned throughout the course.

## Project Template

The template for this project is based on the HTML template provided in the course, which can be found at:  
[Frontend Template for ReactJS Course](https://github.com/dangthuyenvuong/frontend-template/tree/master/course_html_template).

## Key Features
- **ReactJS Components**: Utilizing functional components, hooks, and state management.
- **Learning Focus**: This project covers the core ReactJS concepts such as JSX, props, state, useEffect, useHooks, and event handling.

## Purpose

This project is meant for educational purposes and serves as an implementation of key ReactJS principles in a real-world scenario. It is intended to help beginners and learners get practical experience with ReactJS.

## Important

Some features are still in development and are not yet fully implemented in the current version. These features will be added in future updates:

- **Real course purchase functionality**: Purchase courses online will be available.
- **Project completion tracking**: Tracking which course you have completed.
- **Payment history**: Users will be able to view their past transactions.
- **Coin management**: The system for earning and managing virtual coins (which can be used as discounts for future courses).
